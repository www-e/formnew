# Project Plan

This document outlines the tasks to be completed for the student registration project.

## Phase 1: Analysis and Planning

- [x] Create `.gemini` directory for project planning and tracking.
- [x] Create `plan.md` and `.gemini.md`.
- [x] Analyze the entire project codebase to understand the architecture, identify the root causes of the bugs, and plan the implementation of new features.

## Phase 2: Bug Fixing

- [x] **IndexedDB Data Persistence:** Investigated and fixed the IndexedDB data saving issue, especially after CSV import. Ensured that all data is correctly persisted across sessions. This is the highest priority.
- [x] **Attendance Page Filters:** Debugged and fixed the filters on the attendance page to ensure they correctly filter and display the data. This includes fixing the group filter population based on the selected grade.
- [x] **Attendance Page Styling:** Applied the correct styling for the attendance states (ح, غ, ت) in the attendance table.
- [x] **Month Navigation:** Fixed the "next" and "past" month buttons on the attendance page to correctly navigate between months and update the view.

## Phase 3: Enhancements

- [x] **Data Persistence:** Enhanced the backup and restore functionality to allow users to save and load the entire database as a JSON file. This will provide a robust way to manage data.
- [x] **CSV Import/Export:** Reviewed and improved the CSV import and export functionality to ensure it is flawless and handles all student data correctly.
- [x] **Responsiveness:** Enhanced the responsiveness of all UI elements across the application to ensure a better experience on mobile devices.

## Phase 4: Code Quality and Structure

- [x] **Code Refactoring:** Refactored the code where necessary to improve its structure, maintainability, and adherence to SoC principles.
- [x] **Folder Structure:** Ensured the project follows a feature-based folder structure.

## Phase 5: Final Review and Testing

- [x] **Testing:** Thoroughly tested all the fixes and new features.
- [x] **Final Review:** Conducted a final review of the project to ensure all requirements have been met.
